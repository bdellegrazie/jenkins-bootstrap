# Bucket to be prepended to the metrics you are sending (with trailing period). Example:
# service.jenkins.pipeline-metrics.
# Final metrics paths will follow the pattern:
# {bucket}.{folder}.{subfolder}.{job name}.{branch}.job.status
# {bucket}.{folder}.{subfolder}.{job name}.{branch}.job.duration
# {bucket}.{folder}.{subfolder}.{job name}.{branch}.stage.{stage name}.status
# {bucket}.{folder}.{subfolder}.{job name}.{branch}.stage.{stage name}.duration
# Note: For non multibranch pipelines the branch portion of the path is omitted.
